deduplink
=========

This ruby file creates a random linked list of numbers, some of which duplicate. It then checks the duplicates, puts them in their place, and deletes them.

Just load the file and run it, if you want to see how it works without the array, uncomment the deduper and comment out the old loop.

Phase 1 (with the data structure) has a big O(n), and without the array it has a big O(n^2).
